        <h2>Expectations</h2>
        <p class="table-container">My Expectations of this course is that it's going to be not easy.
            It'll be revisiting some concepts to refresh my skills and learn
            new skills. I expect some of my peers to share ideas and take some
            ideas and turn them into a unique one or just improve them. This 
            course will help me maintain and improve myself for the field. I 
            also expect the teacher to help us students whenever we need help,
            guide us and not fully rely on AI.

        <h2>Motivations</h2>
        <p class="table-container">My motivations are simple, to pass this course, graduate college,
            the fear of being left behind to keep me catching up, the help
            I've received specially from my parents who supported me on this
            journey.

        <h2>Contributions</h2>
        <p class="table-container">My contributions will be my time and effort for this course. I will
            dedicate some time for this course to learn some parts that I'm not familiar with.
            The effort that I will make will be either minimal or significant depending on how unfamiliar
            I am with the problem I'm dealing with.

        <h2>Hindrances</h2>
        <p class="table-container">My biggest hindrace will be myself, if I don't adjust and be lazy.
            The other hindraces will come from the internet service provider because PLDT is slow, the
            unexpected accidents or illnesses that will follow, the weather and natural disasters.
